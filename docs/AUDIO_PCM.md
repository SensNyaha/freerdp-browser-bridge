# Native PCM foundation

Implements the first isolated part of SPECIFICATION §2.6, ARCHITECTURE §5 and
Stage 6. The worker does not yet register an audio backend or advertise playback.
No audio IPC or public wire layout changes in this block.

`native/audio/pcm.hpp` accepts unsigned PCM8 or signed little-endian PCM16,
one or two channels, and integer rates from 8,000 through 48,000 Hz. It emits
interleaved signed S16LE stereo at 48,000 Hz. Mono is duplicated; stereo order
and signed PCM16 extremes are preserved. Float, wider samples, more channels and
rates above 48 kHz are explicitly rejected. Higher-rate conversion requires an
antialiasing downsampler and remains open; this is not complete format coverage.

Upsampling uses linear interpolation with an integer rational phase carried
between aligned packets. The first source sample is emitted immediately. An
interval is emitted only once its next source endpoint is known; no synthetic
end-of-stream tail is appended. With N source frames, the total output is
`1 + floor((N - 1) * 48000 / inputRate)`. Splitting source frames between packets
does not change output bytes. Interpolation division truncates toward zero.
This is a baseline correctness path; production quality/Opus integration remain.

The normalizer allocates one fixed 19,200-byte output buffer at construction.
Processing allocates no memory. Input is bounded to 65,536 bytes and must contain
whole source frames. A call may emit at most 4,800 stereo frames (100 ms). Complete
output size and cumulative frame count are checked before reading source samples
or changing phase/history. Invalid or over-capacity packets return an empty result
and preserve stream state. Callers must handle rejection without blocking the RDP
loop; no implicit slicing, queue or retry exists here.

One serialized owner operates the instance. Returned bytes borrow the fixed
buffer until the next process, reset, successful configure or destruction; a
consumer must copy into bounded storage before another call. Invalid configure
preserves the previous format/state. Successful configure and explicit reset
discard interpolation history and reset the frame counter. Reset keeps the format.
Reconnect, format changes and loss require explicit discontinuity handling in the
future pipeline. There is no thread synchronization or host audio-device access.

Portable tests cover independent sample vectors, signed extremes, packet
fragmentation, a ten-second rational clock, bounds, rejection atomicity and reset.
See [iteration 36](ITERATION_036.md). These tests do not prove RDPSND negotiation,
remote audible output, browser playback, microphone support or LAN queue latency.
